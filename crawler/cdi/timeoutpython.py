# Here is Alex Martelli's solution as a module with proper process killing. The other approaches do not work because they do not use proc.communicate(). So if you have a process that produces lots of output, it will fill its output buffer and then block until you read something from it.

    '''
    Run a command with a timeout after which it will be forcibly
    killed.

        alarm(timeout)
    try:
        stdout, stderr = p.communicate()
        if timeout != -1:
            alarm(0)

        if kill_tree:

            # process might have died before getting to this line
            # so wrap to avoid OSError: no such process
            try: 
                kill(pid, SIGKILL)
