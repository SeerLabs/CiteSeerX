th

Telecommunications Policy Research Conference,
September 25, 2000
Background

Something suspiciously resembling a double standard exists in US regulation of
broadband access carriers. Incumbent local exchange carriers---ILECs---are
required to open access to their networks for competing service providers, while
cable television companies are not. Where did Congress and the FCC get it
right? In the telco case, where open access is required, and there is a nascent
competitive market for telephony and DSL services, or in the case of cable data
networks, where consumers have no choice but to buy their service from the
cable company's affiliated ISP? Or is disparity the best policy?
ILECs are indignant at the double standard. They say, impose the same
standards on both pipelines. Either place the same burden on our competitors,
or, better yet, free us from open access requirements, too. Cable companies, for
their part, deny that their behavior is anti-competitive. They feel they deserve to
be free to compete with the ILECs as best they can.
The FCC recognizes the dilemma of its stance on broadband open access. The
Commission wants to promote investment, deployment, and free, market-driven

outcomes. But any open access requirements it imposes on broadband access
carriers---whether justified or not---will discourage investment in infrastructure.
(Just how significant that discouragement to investment would be is not clear.)
On the other hand, if the Commission sits ...

1. The Challenge

The `new economy' of ubiquitous electronic markets entails new risks and demands
novel responses. Such markets, for one, give unprecedented scope to open participation
by software agents, whose unique strengths and weaknesses enable a whole range of
novel failure modes. Software agents can, for example, be replicated almost indefinitely,
operate extremely rapidly, and can be very difficult to trace back to their humans
`owners'. These attributes make electronic markets susceptible to such phenomena as
denial of service attacks, which have halted operations at many major businesses [1] [2],
in addition to many others such as `bid snatching' (wherein a set of malicious colluding
agents effectively halt another agent by using attractive bids to fraudulently `snatch' and
non-perform on all the targets' subcontracts), `bid collision loops" (where a pair of agents
halt a Dutch auction by establishing an infinite loop of colliding bids), and so on. The
range of attack types and corresponding responses is growing (see [3] for example) and
seems limited only by human creativity. Even the mechanisms used to help avoid
malicious agent behavior, such as reputation servers, are themselves prone to such attacks
as collusive reputation manipulation [4]. Electronic markets also give unprecedented
scope to t...

Summary. We report results from fifteen computerized double auctions with concurrent
trading of two commodities. In contrast to prior experimental markets, buyers' demands
are induced via CES earnings functions defined over the two traded goods, with a fiat
money expenditure constraint. Sellers receive independent marginal cost arrays for each
commodity. Parameters for buyers' earnings functions and sellers' costs are set to yield
a stable, competitive equilibrium. In spite of the complexity introduced by the demand
interdependence, the competitive model is a good predictor of market outcomes, although
prices tend to be above (below) the competitive prediction in the low-price (high-price)
market.

Keywords and phrases: Induced utility, general equilibrium, double auction

everal popular and useful search engines---such as AltaVista, Excite,
HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos, and Northern Light---attempt to maintain
full-text indexes of the World Wide Web. However, relying on
a single standard search engine has limitations. The standard search engines
have limited coverage,

outdated databases, and are sometimes unavailable
due to problems with the network or the engine itself. The precision
of standard engine results can also vary because they generally focus on
handling queries quickly and use relatively simple ranking schemes.

3

Rankings
can be further muddled by keyword "spamming" to increase a page's
rank order. Often, the relevance of a particular page is obvious only after
loading it and finding the query terms.
Metasearch engines, such as MetaCrawler and SavvySearch, attempt
to contend with the problem of limited coverage by submitting queries
to several standard search engines at once.

The primary advantages of
metasearch engines are that they combine the results of several search
engines and present a consistent user interface.

However, most
metasearch engines rely on the documents and summaries returned by
standard search engines and so inherit their limited precision and vulnerability

Replication of Organizational Routines: Conceptualizing the
Exploitation of Knowledge Assets.
The replication of organizational routines, as in the case where best practices are
replicated within an organization or when a business system is deployed in a new geographical
locale, provides a particularly vivid example of the idea of leveraging knowledge assets.
Organizations that intentionally replicate practices and/or business models could be propitious
settings for the systematic study of the management of knowledge assets. Yet, systematic study
of the exploitation of knowledge assets in such settings requires conceptual infrastructure that is
not yet fully in place. The replication of organizational routines offers a conceptual lens that
could fill this theoretical gap. However, replication requires careful specification to be useful as
an analytical approach to design experiments in knowledge management. In this chapter, we
begin the journey towards such specification. First, we distinguish replication from conceptual
neighbors such as the transfer of technology, and the diff...

Capabilities as Real Options
Strategy research consists of a balance between positive and normative theory. In recent years,
normative theory has drawn heavily from industrial economics for its positive justification. Resource
and knowledge-based theories of strategy, however, rely on research on organizations as a
complementary foundation to industrial economics.

are entering a period of turbulent, systemic change in the organization of the world
economic and political order--a period comparable to the transition from the feudal to the modern
era in the 16

th

and 17

th

centuries. As Hobsbawm (1990: 174) observes, the late 20

economy appears temporally confused, involving a "curious combination of the technology of the

, and the rebirth of the sort of interstitial centres
characteristic of world trade in the Middle Ages." *
In this volume globalization is defined generally as a set of processes leading to the
integration of economic activity in factor, intermediate, and final goods and services markets
across geographical boundaries, and the increased salience of cross-border value chains in
international economic flows. More specifically, I argue that globalization entails two
interrelated, technologically driven phenomena.
First, dramatic increases in the cost, risk and complexity of technology in many industries
render even the largest national markets too small to serve as meaningful economic units.
Second, and more important here, the emerging global world economy is e...

The International Monetary Fund defines globalization as broader and deeper integration,
"...the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume
and variety of cross-border transactions in goods and services and of international capital flows,
and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology" (IMF 1997:45). While
there have been dramatic increases in international economic integration during last 30 years,
change has been particularly intense over the last decade. During this period (roughly the mid
80s to the mid 90s) trade grew twice as fast as world output, foreign direct investment three
times as fast, and cross-border trade in shares ten times as fast (Economist 1997: 79).
Integration of markets has expanded opportunities for developing countries. Participation
in international trade "...improves resource allocation, enhances efficiency by increasing
competition among firms, and induces learning and technology transfer, thus facilitating growth"
(World Bank1996:3,4). One cannot, however, consider the developing world as a coherent
whole. While many countries have experienced considerable economic growth and development
over the past three decades --- indeed several are now "newly industrialized"--- large numbers
have grown relatively and absolutely ...

Hoffman, Novak & Peralta (1998), "Building Consumer Trust" 2
Moving Web consumers along to the "purchase click" is proving to be difficult. Current consumer
online shopping revenues are meager, though the industry is optimistic, thanks to bullish forecasts
of cyberconsumer activity for the new millennium. In 1996, Internet shopping revenues for
United States users, excluding cars and real estate, were estimated at approximately $707 million,
but are expected to hit nearly $37.5 billion by 2002 [1]. Meanwhile, the business-to-business side
is taking off with over $8 billion logged in revenues for 1997 and $327 billion predicted by 2002,
for the United States alone [2]. On the consumer side, a variety of barriers are invoked to explain
the difficulties.
To be sure, numerous barriers do exist. Oft-cited factors like too few online consumers interested

A Parsimonious Model of SKU Choice:

Familiarity-based Reinforcement and Response Sensitivity

Summary

We develop a highly parsimonious model to describe and predict stock-keeping unit
(SKU) choice in any frequently-bought consumer packaged good category. The model
has 20 parameters for a category that has 3 salient attributes, and in general it has
8 + 4

k parameters for a k-attribute product category. This parsimony is accomplished
by neither discarding part of the data nor aggregating the level of analysis. Unlike
previous choice models, the number of parameters is neither a function of the number
of SKUs nor a function of the number of attribute levels in the category. Consequently,
it is particularly useful for modeling product choice in categories that have many SKUs
and attribute levels.

The model assumes that a product consists of multiple attributes and the consumer
derives utility from both consuming and shopping for each attribute. While consumption
occurs only for the chosen attribute level...

We investigate product life cycles in the commercial mainframe computer market. We use hazard models
with time-varying covariates to estimate the probability of product exit and Poisson models to estimate
the probability of introduction. We measure the importance of different aspects of market structure, such
as the degree of competitiveness, cannibalization, vintage, product niche and firm effects. We find
evidence of a relationship between the determinants of product exit and product entry.

Natural systems are based on parallel, distributed processing at many different levels. At
the neural level, interconnected and concurrently acting neurons propagate signals among
themselves such that coherent behavior emerges from their joint activity. Within the brain,
different neural subsystems combine and exchange signals to work together to yield an overall
intelligent nervous system. And beyond the boundaries of a single intelligent entity are other
such entities, which together comprise societies that achieve more than the individual entities
can. Thus, what constitutes an "individual" can be highly subjective: An individual to one
researcher can, to another, be a complex distributed system comprised of finer-grained agents.
In this context, an agent's "granularity" corresponds to the amount of processing it
does between interactions with others. Research in Brain Theory and Neural Networks has
concentrated, not surprisingly, on the finer-grained levels of intelligence evidenced in the
brain, drawing on neurophysiology and psychology as sources of inspiration when trying to
build computational models of such natural systems. Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI)
has instead focused on coarser-grained levels of individuality and interaction, where the goal
is to draw upon sociological, political, and economic insights to develop what might be more
closely described as computational models of societies [Gasser, 1991].

But the roots of DAI are actually not far from brain theoretic and neural network concerns.

TITLE: THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AS A MARKETING TOOL
SUMMARY
Current literature treats the initial public offering (IPO) as strictly a capital
acquisition or a financial signalling event. Practitioners intuitively appreciate that it can
also have substantial marketing effect in terms of increased revenue trends and better
revenue to sales expense ratios. In addition it points to the possibilities of estimating
the financial value of the marketing effects. This would allow a recalculation of the cost
of capital using the IPO. The current popularity of IPO's adds to the importance of

This effort has been sponsored, in part, by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-9010645
and Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology grant IRI-9015423.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emphasized building "stand-alone systems" that can solve
problems with minimal help from other systems (computer or human). These systems have
traditionally been brittle, in the sense that they fail miserably when presented with problems
even slightly outside of their limited range of expertise. The predominant AI answer to
brittleness is to inject more knowledge into a system, including commonsense knowledge,
to enlarge the system's range of capabilities. While in the short term such a strategy can
overcome particular system limitations, it is in fact a very short-sighted strategy.

A more powerful, extensible strategy for overcoming the inherent bounds of intelligence
present in any finite AI (or natural) system [64, 83, 84] is to put the system in a society of
systems, so that it can draw on a diverse collection of expertise and capabilities in the same
way that people overcome the limitations of individuals by banding together into societies
that are designed to accomplish what individuals cannot. The ability to flexibly team up and
coordinate group activities toward individual and collective goals is a hallmark of intelligence.
Research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) concentrates on understanding the
knowledge and reasoning techniques needed for intelligent coordination, and on embodying
and eval...

ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS
AND THE
VIRTUAL CORPORATION
Yannis Bakos* and Erik Brynjolfsson**
Chapter 4 in Information Technology and Industrial Competitiveness: How

Information Technology Shapes Competition, Kluwer Academic Publishers,
1997
Organizations are transforming their relationships with their business partners.

For example, instead of playing off dozens or even hundreds of competing

suppliers against each other, many firms are finding it more profitable to work

closely with only a small number of "partners". While these firms generally

increase their amount of outsourcing, by focusing on a small number of partners

they create value networks that are often referred to as "value-addedpartnerships

", "virtual organizations" or "modular corporations". In this work

we explore some causes and consequences of this transformation. We apply the

economic theory of incomplete contracts to study the optimal number of business

partners, with particular attention to the role of information technology.

Surprisingly, we find that organizations will often maximize profits by limiting

their options and reducing their own bargaining power. This may seem

paradoxical in an age of cheap communications costs and aggressive competition.

However, unlike earlier studies that focused on coordination costs, we focus on the

critical importance of providing incentives for business partners. Our results

spring from the need to make it worthwhile for business partners to invest in "noncontractibles

" like innovation, responsiveness and information sharing. Such

incentives will be stronger when the number of competing partners is small. The

findings of the theoretical models appear to be consistent with obse...

Decentralized scheduling is the problem of allocating resources to alternative possible

uses over time, where competing uses are represented by autonomous agents. Market mechanisms

use prices derived through distributed bidding protocols to determine schedules.

We investigate the existence of equilibrium prices for some general classes of scheduling

problems, the quality of equilibrium solutions, and the behavior of an ascending auction

mechanism and bidding protocol. To remedy the potential nonexistence of price equilibria

due to complementarities in preference, we introduce additional markets in combinations

of basic goods. Finally, we consider direct revelation mechanisms, and compare to the

market-based approach.

Information Technology Spending and Economic Productivity:

A review of The Trouble with Computers by Thomas K. Landauer
Yannis Bakos
University of California, Irvine

Journal of Economic Literature, September 1996
Information technology has become a significant component of new capital investment
(some estimates put it at 30%) and several economists look to computers as the best hope for
a sustainable increase in economic growth rates. Thus questions about the productivity of
computer investment are a serious matter. In his book The Trouble with Computers (MIT
Press, 1995), Thomas K. Landauer argues that computers have been unproductive because
of poor design and deployment. To support this thesis, Landauer draws on economic data
and analysis as reported by other researchers, and offers voluminous anecdotal evidence of
computer shortcomings. He then proceeds to offer his own solution to this productivity
problem, based on a set of "user-centered" principles for the design, development and
deployment of computer systems.
Landauer makes an articulate argument that computers can be improved in ways that
would make them more useful, usable and productive. Unfortunately he succumbs to the
fallacy that since computers can be greatly improved, they must be unproductive. The
Trouble with Computers is peppered with entertaining and often insightful anecdotes about
the shortcomings of computer systems, such as poorly designed voicemail systems, ordering
15 items from a mail-order vendor which arrived in 15 separate shipments, increasing paper
output rather than useful work, inflexible systems that try to seat him far from his 5-year old
daughter, or systems that are counterintuitive and difficult to u...

ubiquitous access provided by the World
Wide Web. Intuitively, the cost of academic
journals should be decreasing rather than
increasing.
At the same time, the number of scholarly
journals whose primary venue is online has
increased by an order of magnitude since
1994 (from 181 to 1093).

2

(The Information
Economy Web site carries a list of electronic
journals: http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/
resources/infoecon/EPublish.html.)

A pressing question is: if online publishing
of academic information replaces traditional
print publication, will this result in
significant cost savings? And if so, will the
quality of published material be retained?
Improved? And finally, what catalysts are
needed to move scholars away from their
traditional modes of publishing?
Andrew Odlyzko has written thoughtful
discussions of roadblocks to and advantages
of electronic publishing,

4, 5

and Hal
Varian has predicted the criteria that would
have to be met to make academic electronic
publishing viable.

6

Publishers are exploring a wide variety
of pricing models. The JSTOR project

7

imposes differential pricing by institution:
those that are rated as having a larger need
for the service are charged more.

6

Steve
Harnad has suggested charging authors (or
their institutions) a "page" fee when their
paper is accepted for publication, as a way
to help disseminate the work.

7

And at least
one study has found that the better accessibility
of online journals increased the number
of subscriptions.

8

Some publishers are now making online
access available to journals at an additional
cost beyond that of the paper-version subscriptions.

A major problem that firms face when they
invest in information technology (IT) is ensuring
that the systems that they build and deploy will
actually pay off. In our experience, it is not
unusual for IT departments to engage in costly and
lengthy development efforts only to find out, after
completing the work, that the technology has not
been very well accepted by its intended users [3].
Often, the initial expectations of the managers who
have developed the value proposition and strategic

plan for the system are wrong, too. It is quite
natural for IT investors to look at industry estimates
for the stock of IT capital that is needed to run a

business (for example, by reference to the annual IT
investment surveys of International Data
Corporation (IDC) that are published in
InformationWeek magazine). The problem is that
senior managers and investors often develop
expectations about the likely payoffs of their IT
investments without taking into consideration a

number of crucial specifics: their firm's
organization, other supporting resources that are
simultaneously available to ensure smooth
implementation and user acceptance, and ...

Kyburgian Acceptance: A Rejection, Hedged

Michael P. Wellman

University of Michigan

Department of EECS

Ann Arbor MI 48109

wellman@engin.umich.edu

Appeared as a Taking Issue response to Henry E. Kyburg, Jr., Believing on
the basis of the evidence, Computational Intelligence 10(1), 1994.

There seems to be something about probability that offends some people
's (not necessarily Kyburg's) sense of taste. Not being of this aesthetic
persuasion, I can only speculate that assigning degrees of belief to propositions
is seen as a cop-out; a true believer should either adopt a proposition
or not, eschewing compromise. Those who would reject probability need not
deny uncertainty, however. Instead, they argue, one can accommodate the
inevitable incompleteness in immediate knowledge by an appropriate belief
revision policy.

Philosophers have assigned the term acceptance to this notion of categorically
adopting an uncertain belief and acting as though it were the case.
That acceptance is semantically elusive and technically complicated is evidenced
by the volume of philosophical debate on the subject as well as the
mass of AI research on nonmonotonic logic aimed at working it out computationally.
That this AI work is essentially attacking the problem of acceptance
is not often explicitly recognized, and Kyburg's clear exposition of this point
is one of his essay's important contributions. The other, of course, is his own
proposed account of acceptance.

In taking issue with Kyburg, I attempt first to explain why we might
want a theory of acceptance. My claim is that our quest can and should
be justified on pragmatic computational grounds, rather than those purely
philosophical (I'm not...

to appear in ACM Computing Surveys Symposium on Artificial Intelligence

To take an economic approach to anything typically invokes three premises.
First, that the fundamental problem to be solved is one of resource allocation.

Second, that it is useful to model behavior in terms of a rationality
abstraction. And third, that it is essential to consider how authority and
activity may be decentralized. All three of these premises are being
increasingly adopted (explicitly or implicitly) in artificial intelligence, and
growing numbers of AI researchers are working within the economic
paradigm.

Resource Allocation

Computer scientists like to view a program as an abstract specification of a

machine, describable behaviorally in terms of the input/output relationship
resulting from its computation. The machine's product is its output,
representing the value of a function at the point represented by its input.
Often we find it helpful to view this product at a higher level, say, as the
solution to some well-posed problem. Inevitably, this problem bears on what
we are to do, that is, some course of action to be embarked upon. (Conceptions
of computation as answering questions are a relic of the era when human
intermediaries were necessary to perform the transduction from computation
to action.) In this view, the computer is a<...

The Emerging Landscape for Retail E-Commerce

*

Stern School of Business
New York University
Online retail sales of goods and services are projected to grow from $45 billion in 2000,
or 1.5% of total retail sales, to $155 billion in 2003, and to $269 billion in 2005, or 7.8% of total
retail sales projected for that year (Dykema 2000). In addition to this substantial growth in
online sales, consumers increasingly rely on information collected online to research a lot of
purchases that are concluded over traditional "bricks and mortar" channels, especially for high
value durable goods, such as electronics and automobiles. Such purchases influenced by the
Internet are estimated to grow from $13 billion in 2000 to $146 billion in 2003 and $378 billion
in 2005 (Dykema 2000), or 10.8% of projected retail sales. This would bring the total retail sales
affected by e-commerce in 2005 to $647 billion, or 18.5% of total retail sales.
Retail e-commerce is evolving to encompass a wide variety of goods and services.
Leisure travel will be the leading category in 2000 with 27.2% of online sales, followed by
books, music, videos and software (14.9%), computers and electronics (13.6%) and apparel
(11.3%). By 2005, consumables (food, beverages, supplies, health and beauty aids, pet supplies,
etc) are projected to amount to 18% of online retail sales, followed by apparel (16%), computers
and electronics (12.4%), automobiles (12.2%) and leisure travel (12.1%), while the share of
books, music, videos and software will fall to 9.6% (Dykema 2000).

Providing per-flow QoS typically requires some form of admission control; that is, flows
must explicitly request service from the network and the network has the option of denying
the request. Traditional admission control algorithms for hard real-time services (i.e.,
services that provide a firm delay bound) use worst case analyses based on the traffic parameters
provided by arriving flows. Such parameter-based admission control algorithms
necessarily result in low utilization when the traffic is quite bursty. Soft real-time services
such as Controlled Load [8] can use more relaxed admission control algorithms. For instance,
one can use measurements to characterize the current load, rather than relying
on worst-case analysis. Measurement-based admission control algorithms (MBACs) have
been shown to achieve much higher utilization than parameter-based admission control
algorithms [5]. There has been much research interest in MBACs, and several new MBACs
have been proposed; see [2, 3, 4, 6, 7] for some examples. This research has typically
focused on the equations (and, to a lesser extent, the measurement algorithms) used to
decide whether or not to accept an incoming flow. These proposals range from the simple
and ad hoc to...

Tools for Teaching Change Management:

and Supporting Software
Erik Brynjolfsson, Marshall Van Alstyne, Abraham Bernstein and Amy Renshaw
One of the key advantages of information technology is its ability to support new
organizational forms. The task of shifting between old and new forms, however, can be
a difficult, time consuming, and haphazard process (Davenport, 1993, Davenport and
Stoddard, 1994; Hammer, 1990). Interactions among various work practices can lead to
numerous unanticipated side effects as mangers alter individual practices without
considering whole systems of work. In particular, the importance of complementarities
among different practices has been formalized mathematically in the economic literature
(Milgrom and Roberts, 1990). However, practicing managers and students have had
difficult in applying these insights.

This talk will present recent developments in providing support tools for change
management and explain how they have been effectively used for teaching students about ITenabled
change management in the core IT classes a...

How to Enhance Market Liquidity

Exchange in financial markets may be diversified in a variety of dimensions. They may
differ in the attributes of the traded assets, in the location of the exchange, in the time of the
transaction, and in the manner that the transaction takes place. Further, markets differ in the
degree of participation of intermediaries and in the role they play in the market.

Certain aspects of diversification are inherently desirable to market participants. Some
types of financial exchange diversification are necessary for the particular way that the market
works, including the way in which price is discovered in the market. Still other types of
diversification arise naturally out of competition among exchanges. The variety of possible
organizations of financial markets allows for comparisons among them. First we need to define
the criteria of evaluation.

A financial exchange should be structured so as to maximize the satisfaction of
participants and potential participants. This is accomplished by minimizing tran...

We are interested in building systems of autonomous agents that can automate

routine information processing activities in human organizations. Computational

infrastructures for cooperative work should contain embedded agents for handling

many routine tasks [9], but as the number of agents increases and the agents

become geographically and/or conceptually dispersed, supervision of the agents

will become increasingly problematic. We argue that agents should be provided

with deep domain knowledge that allows them to make quantitatively justifiable

decisions, rather than shallow models of users to mimic. In

Preface

Many designs for Integrated Services Packet Networks (ispn) offer a bounded delay
packet delivery service to support real-time applications. Networks achieve bounded
delay by regulating their load and managing their resources. Admission control algorithm
is the tool networks use to regulate their load. Previous work on admission
control mainly focused on algorithms that compute the worst case theoretical queueing
delay to guarantee either an absolute delay bound for all packets or a probabilistic
bound on the statistical distribution tail of aggregate traffic. Since worst-case bounds
are computed from parameterized source models, we call such algorithms parameterbased
algorithms. Our own work proposes a measurement-based admission control
algorithm for predictive service. Instead of guaranteeing an absolute or a numerically
enforced probabilistic bound, predictive service promises a reliable bound. With the
more relaxed bound, an admission control algorithm can operate without requiring
a precise characterization of traffic; instead, it can use measured traffic characteristics.
The reliance of our admission control algorithm on measurement dictates that
it works well only when there is a high degree statistical multiplexing. Several researchers
have disco...

PERFORMANCE, COMPENSATION, AND
THE BALANCED SCORECARD
A growing number of firms are replacing their financially-based performance measurement
and compensation systems with a "balanced scorecard" incorporating multiple financial and nonfinancial
indicators. Proponents of the balanced scorecard concept contend that this approach
provides a powerful means for translating a firm's vision and strategy into a tool that effectively
communicates strategic intent and motivates performance against established strategic goals
(Kaplan and Norton, 1996). However, the balanced scorecard literature provides little discussion
of the scorecard's role in compensation decisions, despite the fact that the majority of adopters use
the scorecard for this purpose (Towers Perrin, 1996). The limited discussion of performance
evaluation and compensation issues raises a number of questions regarding how the multiple
performance measures and their relative weights are chosen to ensure "balance" in the
compensation plan, the appropriate role of subjective versus formula-driven performance
evaluations, the choice of qualitative versus quantitative performance measures, and the extent to
which managers' understanding of strategic objectives and managerial actions vary with different
forms of scorecard-based incentive plans. These questions are all the more interesting b...

Common arguments for including applications papers in the Machine Learning
literature are often based on the papers' value for advertising success stories and
for morale boosting. For example, high-profile applications can help to secure
funding for future research and can help to attract high caliber students. However,
there is another reason why such papers are of value to the field, which is, arguably,
even more vital. Application papers are essential in order for Machine Learning to
remain a viable science. They focus research on important unsolved problems that
currently restrict the practical applicability of machine learning methods.

Much of the "science" of Machine Learning is a science of engineering.

to the design and construction of artifacts. The scientific knowledge comprises theoretical
arguments, observational categorizations, empirical studies, and practical
demonstrations. The artifacts are computer programs that use data to build models
that are practically or theoretically useful. Because the objects of study are
intended to have practical utility, it is essential for research activities to be focused

We present an extensive breakdown of the auctiondesignspace that captures the essential

similarities and differences of many auction mechanisms in a format more descriptive

and useful than simple taxonomies. This parametrization serves as an organizational

framework in which to classify work within the field, and uncoversparameter combinations

corresponding to novel mechanisms. The structured characterization of auction rules can

be exploited for the modular design of configurable auction servers. It also facilitates the

communication of auction rules to software agents, enabling the automation of flexible

market-based negotiation.

Synopsis

Artificial intelligence, on the one hand, and behavioral and social science on the other,

are inextricably related because the ability to coordinate in multiagent environments

is fundamental to intelligence. Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) has used several

different social metaphors as the basis for building computational theories of intelligent

coordination, with significant success. However, the real challenge in developing general

theories of coordination is in bridging between the different perspectives implicit in the

various social metaphors. In

Decentralized scheduling is the problem of allocating resources to alternative possible

uses over time, where competing uses are represented by autonomous agents. Market mechanisms

use prices derived through distributed bidding protocols to determine schedules.

We investigate the existence of equilibrium prices for some general classes of scheduling

problems, the quality of equilibrium solutions, and the behavior of an ascending auction

mechanism and bidding protocol. To remedy the potential nonexistence of price equilibria

due to complementarities in preference, we introduce additional markets in combinations

of basic goods. Finally, we consider direct revelation mechanisms, and compare to the

market-based approach.

Efficiently Constructing Relational Features from Background Knowledge for

Most existing inductive learning systems form concept descriptions in propositional languages
from vectors of basic features. However, many concepts are characterized by the relationships
of individual examples to general domain knowledge. We describe a system that constructs relational
terms efficiently to augment the description language of standard inductive systems. In
our approach, examples and domain knowledge are combined into an inheritance network, and a
form of spreading activation is used to find relevant relational terms. Since there is an equivalence
between inheritance networks and relational databases, this yields a method for exploring
tables in the database and finding relevant relationships among data to characterize concepts. We
also describe the implementation of a prototype system on the CM-2 parallel computer and some
experiments with large data sets.

Executive Summary. On-To-Knowledge, the European EU-IST project No.

10132, builds an ontology-based tool environment to speed up knowledge

management, dealing with the large numbers of heterogeneous, distributed,

and semi-structured documents typically found in large company intranets

and the World-Wide Web. Results aimed for by the project are: (1) a toolset

for semantic information processing and user access; (2) OIL, an ontologybased

inference layer on top of the World-Wide Web; (3) an associated

methodology; (4) validation by industrial case studies.

Panel: Is Generic Metadata Management Feasible?

Philip A. Bernstein

Microsoft Corporation

One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399

philbe@microsoft.com

1. Panel Overview

The database field has worked on metadata-related problems
for 30 years. Examples include data translation and
migration, schema evolution, database design, schema /
ontology integration, XML wrapper generation, data
scrubbing and transformation for data warehouses, message
mapping for e-business, and schema-driven web site
design. Tools that address these problems are strikingly
similar in their design. Arguably, we are making very
little progress, since we keep reapplying the same old
1970's techniques of data translation [9] and views to one
new problem after another, without getting much leverage
from each succeeding step. Despite all the research on the
above tools, we have so far been unable to offer generalpurpose
database technology that factors out the similar
aspects of these tools into generic database infrastructure.

This panel addresses the following questions:

## Is it feasible to develop a generic infrastructure for 

managing models? If so, what would it need to do, 

beyond what's offered in the best object-oriented 

databases and repositories? 

## Can we devise a useful generic notion of model that 

treats all popular information structures as specializations
(SQL schemas, ER diagrams, XML DTD's, 

object-oriented (OO) schemas, web site maps, make 

scripts, etc.)? 

## Can we produce a generic model manipulation algebra
that generalizes transformation operations developed
for data integration and translation, such as 

union, match, difference, and merge? What about 

generic operations on mappings between...

Applications of modern heuristic search methods to

pattern sequencing problems #

Andreas Fink + Stefan Vo +

May 1998

Scope and Purpose---Pattern sequencing problems have important applications, especially

in the field of production planning. Those problems generally consist of finding

a permutation of predetermined production patterns (groupings of some elementary

order types) with respect to di#erent objectives. These objectives may represent, e.g.,

handling costs or stock capacity restrictions, which usually leads to

NP-hard

problems.

Thus, the use of heuristics to construct respective pattern sequences is generally

assumed to be appropriate.

The use of mobile agent technology has been proposed for various fault-sensitive application areas, including

electronic commerce and systems management. A prerequisite for the use of mobile agents in

these environments is that agents have to be executed reliably, independent of communication and node

failures.

Decentralized scheduling is the problem of allocating resources to alternative possible

uses over time, where competing uses are represented by autonomous agents. Market mechanisms

use prices derived through distributed bidding protocols to determine schedules.

We investigate the existence of equilibrium prices for some general classes of scheduling

problems, the quality of equilibrium solutions, and the behavior of an ascending auction

mechanism and bidding protocol. To remedy the potential nonexistence of price equilibria

due to complementarities in preference, we introduce additional markets in combinations

of basic goods. Finally, we consider direct revelation mechanisms, and compare to the

market-based approach.

Ontobroker in a Nutshell

The World Wide Web (WWW) provides huge amounts of information in informal and
semi-structured representations. This is one of the key factors that enabled its
incredible success story. The representation formalisms are simple and retain a high
degree of freedom in how to present the information. However, freedom in information
representation and simple representation formalisms cause serious bottlenecks in
accessing information from the web. We designed and implemented some tools
necessary to enable the use of ontologies [2] for enhancing the web. We developed a
broker architecture called Ontobroker [1] with three core elements: a query interface
for formulating queries, an inference engine used to derive answers, and a webcrawler
used to collect the required knowledge from the web. The strength of our approach is
the tight coupling of informal, semiformal and formal information and knowledge.
This supports their maintenance and provides a service that can be used more generally
for the purpose of knowledge management and for integrating knowledge-based
reasoning and semiformal representation of documents.

The query formalism is oriented toward a frame-based representation of ontologies
that defines the notion of instances, classes, attributes and values. The structure of the
query language can be exploited to provide a tabular query interface as shown in
Figure 1 which asks for the researchers with last name Benjamins and their email
addresses. We also need s...

We present a new multiagent model for the multiperiod portfolio selection

problem. A system of cooperative agents divide initial wealth and follow

individual worst-case optimal investment strategies from random portfolios,

sharing their final profits and losses. The multiagent system achieves better

average-case performance than a single agent with the same initial wealth in

a simple stochastic market. A further increase in performance is achieved

through communication of hints between agents and probabilistic strategyswitching.

However, this explicit cooperation is redundant in a market that

approximates the Capital Asset Pricing Model, a model of equilibrium stock

price dynamics.

Workshop on Intelligent Information Integration (III99)

D. Fensel, C.A. Knoblock, N. Kushmerick, and M.-C. Rousset

The Workshop on Intelligent Information Integration (III), organized in conjunction with

the Sixteenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-99), was

held on July 31, 1999 in Stockholm, Sweden. Around forty people participated, and

nearly twenty papers were presented. This packed workshop schedule resulted from a

very high number of submissions that made it difficult to reserve discussion time without

rejecting an unproportional large number of papers. Participants included scientists and

practitioners from industry and academia. Topics included query planning, applications

of III, mediator architectures, and the use of ontologies for III.

The

growth of the Internet and other on-line information repositories has greatly simplified the
access to numerous sources of information. But it has become cliche to observe that this growth has
vastly complicated tasks involving finding, extracting, merging or synthesizing such information.
With today's tools, a tourist planning a trip to Paris cannot simply fetch from the Web a map showing
all Italian restaurants close to the Eiffel Tower, although this information may well be available on
the Web if maps of Paris, lists of restaurants, and of tourist sites are combined. The problem is one
not of information distribution, but of information integration. Building tools to simplify access to the
wealth of available information constitutes a significant challenge to Computer Science. Artificial
Intelligence is well-suited to this challenge, with its emphasis on heuristic solutions, knowledge
representation and knowledge-intensive techniques, ex...

NetBill Security and Transaction Protocol

Benjamin Cox, J. D. Tygar, and Marvin Sirbu

Carnegie Mellon University

Pittsburgh, PA

cyberspace with no easily identifiable place of business
for the merchant or physical delivery site for the
customer. Transactions are subject to observation by
third parties sharing the network. And the use of
computers to support transactions makes record keeping
easier, exacerbating privacy problems arising from
transaction data collection by merchants.

Supporting transactions in cyberspace requires
electronic analogs for many familiar procedures from
face-to-face transactions. Parties need to know with
whom they are dealing, or at least verify their
creditworthiness. They need to be able to negotiate
prices, perhaps providing credentials entitling them to
special discounts, such as a student ID. Parents need
methods to control where their children shop in
cyberspace. In the case of information goods, the value
of an item may be as low as a few cents, requiring
transaction mechanisms which impose per-transaction
overheads much smaller than those for typical check
and credit card purchases. Merchants need to restrict the
class of customers they support based on their
credentials, to restrict distribution of sensitive materials.
We are building a system called NetBill which is
optimized for the selling and delivery of low-priced
network goods. A customer, represented by a client
computer, wishes t...

GAMES, COMPUTERS, AND O.R.

by Ehud Kalai*

Kellogg School of Management

Northwestern University

The scientific interaction of game theory with
computer science and operations research is
broad and fundamental. It covers a large variety
of applications in all three fields, and it transfers
concepts, language, and results across fields.
Listing all the areas of overlap will be long and
tedious. I will therefore restrict myself to
discuss a few, easy to present examples, where
the cross-fertilization of ideas was successful,
and point to a need for further research.

Graphs in Games.

In coalitional games it is most often assumed
that the grand coalition, consisting of all the
players, will form. But the process of coalition
formation is often complex, only partial, and
seems difficult to describe mathematically. To
model this process rigorously, Myerson (1977)
introduced the notion of a communication graph,
where each node represents a player and a link
represents the ability of the two linked players
to communicate. He then extended the Shapley
value of the game to reflect this partial
communication ability. Kalai, Postlewaite, and
Roberts (1979), extending the notion of the Core
of a game to incorporate communication graphs,
were able to study and compare different trading
structures. For example: How does complete
free trade, described by a complete comunication
graph, compare with centralized trade, where
each player is only connected to one fixed
middleman?

Multi-Person Operations Research.

Typical operations research problems, where a
single objective function is maximized, model
one person optimization. Often, however, the
real-life problem involves different maximizers
with different objectives and different resources.

We investigate cost-sharing algorithms for multicast transmission. Economic

considerations point to two distinct mechanisms, marginal cost and

Shapley value, as the two solutions most appropriate in this context. We

prove that the former has a natural algorithm that uses only two messages

per link of the multicast tree, while we give evidence that the latter requires

a quadratic total number of messages. We also show that the welfare value

achieved by an optimal multicast tree is NP-hard to approximate within

any constant factor, even for bounded-degree networks. The lower-bound

proof for the Shapley value uses a novel algebraic technique for bounding

from below the number of messages exchanged in a distributed computation;

oving some Web consumers along to the purchase click is proving to be
difficult, despite the impressive recent growth in online shopping. Consumer
online shopping revenues and related corporate profits are still
meager, though the industry is optimistic, thanks to bullish forecasts of
cyberconsumer activity for the new millennium. In 1996, Internet shopping
revenues for U.S. users, excluding cars and real estate, were estimated by Jupiter Communications,

the business-to-business side is taking off with more
than $8 billion in revenues for 1997 and $327 billion
predicted by 2002 just in the U.S., according to Forrester
Research, an information consulting firm in
Cambridge, Mass. [4]. On the consumer side, a variety
of barriers are invoked to explain the continuing
difficulties.

There are, to be sure, numerous barriers. Such
factors as the lack of standard technologies for secure
payment, and the lack of profitable business models
play important roles in the relative dearth of commercial
activity by businesses and consumers on the
Internet compared to what analysts expect in the
near future. Granted, the commercial development
of the Web is still in its infancy, so few expect these
barriers to commercial development to persist. Still,
commercial development of the Web faces a far

We investigate multicast cost sharing from both computational and economic

points of view. Recent work in economics [MS01] leads naturally to the

consideration of two mechanisms: marginal cost (MC), which is ecient and

strategyproof, and Shapley value (SH), which is budget-balanced and groupstrategyproof

and, among all mechanisms with these two properties, minimizes

the worst-case welfare loss. Subsequent work in computer science [FPS00]

shows that the MC mechanism can be computed by a simple, distributed algorithm

that uses only two messages per link of the multicast tree but that

computing the SH mechanism seems, in the worst case, to require a number of

messages that is quadratic in the size of the multicast tree. Here, we extend

these results in two directions. First, we give a group-strategyproof mechanism

that exhibits a tradeo between the other properties of the Shapley value: It

can be computed by an algorithm that is more communication-ecient than

the natural SH algorithm (exponentially more so in the worst case), but it

might fail to achieve exact budget balance or exact minimum welfare loss (albeit

by a bounded amount). Second, we completely characterize the groups

that can strategize successfully against the MC mechanism.

KNOW-HOW

In the knowledge lies the power.
Frederick Hayes-Roth
In the know-how lies the power.
Carl Hewitt
The study of knowledge is crucial to the science of rational agency. This fact
is well-recognized in artificial intelligence (AI) and related fields. However, most
often the form of knowledge that is studied and formalized is the knowledge of
(putative) facts. We refer to this form of knowledge as know-that. Know-that has
proved an extremely successful concept in AI, being the basis of a large number
of AI systems, which are therefore termed knowledge-based.

There is great need, however, for other notions of knowledge as well. In particular,
since rational agency is intimately related to actions, it is important also to
consider the form of knowledge that is about actions and procedures. We refer to
this form of knowledge as know-how. Intuitively, we might think of the distinction
between know-how and know-that as reflecting the distinction between rational
agents and on the one hand, and disembodied minds, such as knowledge-based
expert systems, on the other.

This chapter introduces know-how and allied concepts from a conceptual standpoint.
It presents a formalization of two accounts of know-how borrowed from
[33]. It also and compares reviews a selected subset of the approaches available in
the literature. It seeks to provide the background with which one may understand
the details of the different technical approaches.

Historical Remarks. The noted British philosopher Gilbert Ryle is widely regarded
as having been the first, at least in modern times, to have argued for the
fundamental difference between knowing how and knowing that. Ryle devotes a
chapt...

agents for

in

Virtual

Enterprises

Anuj K. Jain, Manuel Aparicio IV,
and Munindar P. Singh
The agent metaphor, long in study in artificial
intelligence, has recently become popular in mainstream
computing, largely due to its suitability for
open environments. Agents can be thought of as
active objects with some special properties tailored to
open environments. For our purposes, the key aspects
of agents are their autonomy and abilities to perceive,
reason, and act in their environments, as well as to
socially interact and communicate with other agents
[7]. When agents interact with one another they form
a multiagent system. As part of a multiagent system,
agents can capture and apply the semantic constraints
among heterogeneous components in order to enact
distributed workflows.

At first glance, autonomy is a mixed blessing.
O

pen environments such as the Internet---and even
corporate intranets---enable a large number of interested parties
to use and enhance vast quantities of information.
These environments support modern applications, such
as manufacturing, virtual enterprises, and ubiquitous
information access, which involve a number of information
sources and component activities. However, without principled
techniques to coordinate the various activities, any implementation would yield disjointed and
error-prone behavior, while requiring excessive effort to build and maintain.

Autonomy is critical in open environments. Consider
a manufacturing scenario requiring supply-chain
coordination. It is natural to model independent companies
in a supply chain as represented by autonomous
agents. But, ...

Modern approaches to integrity monitoring in active databases suggest
to generate triggers from constraints as part of database design and to
utilize constraint simplification techniques for trigger optimization. Such
proposals, however, have been restricted to static conditions only. In

1 Overview

The tsimmis project [2] provides an architecture and tools for accessing multiple heterogeneous
information sources by translating source information into a common self-describing object model,
called the Object Exchange Model (OEM) [3]. tsimmis provides integrated access to heterogeneous
sources through a layer of source specific translators as well as "intelligent" modules, called
mediators. Translators (wrappers) convert queries over information in the common model (OEM)
into requests the source can execute. The data returned by the source is converted back into the
common model. Mediators are programs that collect information from one or more sources,
process and combine it, and export the resulting information to the end user or an application
program. Users or applications can choose to interact either directly with the translators or
indirectly via one or more mediators.

Figure 1 shows an overview of the tsimmis testbed as it is currently operating in our lab. We
distinguish three different layers: the source layer, the server layer, and the client layer. Starting
at the bottom (source layer), we can see three (disk-shaped) heterogeneous information sources,
containing bibliographic data in three heterogeneous formats:

Our national interests are becoming increasingly dependent on the continuous, proper functioning
of large-scale, heterogeneous, and decentralized computing enterprises. Examples of such
systems abound, ranging from military command and control to vital national security assets such
as the financial and banking system. They are formed from large numbers of components originating
from multiple sources, some trusted and some not, assembled into complex and dynamically
evolving structures. Protecting these interests is critical, yet their sheer scale and diversity has
gone far beyond our organizational and technical abilities to protect them. Manual procedures---
however well designed and tested---cannot keep pace with the dynamicity of the environment
and cannot react to security breaches in a timely and coordinated fashion, especially in the context
of a networked enterprise.

We are designing a secure, automated framework for proactive and reactive reconfiguration of
large-scale, heterogeneous, distributed systems so that cri...

E-mail: jhammer@cise.ufl.edu

Data Warehousing and Decision Support is a graduate--level seminar intended for students and
professionals who are interested in gaining a thorough understanding of the underlying theories and
principles of data warehousing and online analytical processing. Given the explosion of online
information sources, most notably the World Wide Web (Web), the topic of information management in
general and data warehousing in specific has been receiving a lot of attention from the academic
community as well as industry. In this seminar, we examine the problems, principles, techniques, and
mechanisms to support information management using the data warehousing approach. We explore the
current state-of-the-art in both data warehousing and decision support by studying the relevant literature
and surveying selected products from industry. For most students, this course is their first opportunity to
get hands-on experience with data warehouse software and related tools.

The decision to offer this seminar as part of the University's distance education program was
influenced by several factors:

. Given the heightened interest in the area of data warehousing and industry's insatiable demand for
data warehousing specialists, we wanted to find an alternative delivery mechanism for our course in

Integrated Design Systems (IDS) represent integration of broad range of high fidelity

knowledge from expert sources in near real time to synthesize and refine design and

product realization. Such a system should result in an order of magnitude reduction in

product realization time. The characteristics of IDS are: coordination of asynchronous

design activities; conflict management; interoperability among heterogeneous software

and hardware environments to accomplish an effective collaborative computational system,

and to provide tools to facilitate human designer's participation. Due to the constant

evolution of software tools and techniques, IDS should be able to accommodate changes

easily.

Why are pricing issues the

key to infrastructure investment and

future growth of the Internet?

The

Economics of

network

management

I

t is not surprising that researchers in
network technology are utilizing ideas
from the field of economics since it
provides the conceptual understanding
of underlying constructs such as
usage and resource allocation. Proper
resource allocation plays a key role in
improving network performance.
There are two primary approaches to
economic resource allocation: quantity limits, and
pricing. The former has the advantage of low
accounting costs. However, it requires central
administration and, for network users wishing to
purchase more quantity than allocated, a pricing
schedule has to be developed. The pricing
approach does not enforce any quantity limits.
Instead, users self-select the quantity they are willing
to purchase at prevailing prices. The pricing
approach decentralizes the resource allocation
problem but has higher accounting costs since
usage needs to be monitored and billed.

The role of pricing as a resource allocation
mechanism will be examined here, since central
administration of quotas would be difficult in a
global network. Furthermore, a pricing mechanism
may still be needed to meet user demands in
e-commerce. While the short-term role of economic
pricing is to manage the network resources
more efficiently, in the long run it could play an

important role in the design of new network protocols.

For example, new technological developments

with priority classes in the IPv6 Internet

protocol [3] will present the challenge of defining

an economic basis for priority allocation.

A

new electronic financial market is fast

emerging. Connected by high-speed networks,

buyers and sellers are gathering in

virtual marketplaces and revolutionizing

the way business is conducted. The financial

services industry, among the most innovative and

aggressive in its use of IT, has created an entirely new

online brokerage industry in just a few years. In 1996,
there were only 1.5 million online brokerage accounts.

That number was estimated to be 5.3 million

at the end of 1998, and today, these accounts are

responsible for 25 percent of all retail trades.

Future

technological advances will introduce new trading

mechanisms and other new electronic markets.

The principal functions of financial markets are to

1 Overview

In order to access information from a variety of heterogeneous
information sources, one has to be able to
translate queries and data from one data model into
another. This functionality is provided by so-called
(source) wrappers [4,8] which convert queries into one
or more commands/queries understandable by the underlying
source and transform the native results into a
format understood by the application. As part of the
tsimmis project [1, 6] we have developed hard-coded
wrappers for a variety of sources (e.g., Sybase DBMS,
WWW pages, etc.) including legacy systems (Folio).
However, anyone who has built a wrapper before can
attest that a lot of effort goes into developing and writing
such a wrapper. In situations where it is important
or desirable to gain access to new sources quickly,
this is a major drawback. Furthermore, we have also
observed that only a relatively small part of the code
deals with the specific access details of the source. The
rest of the code is either common among wrappers or
implements query and data transformation that could
be expressed in a high level, declarative fashion.

Based on these observations, we have developed a
wrapper implementation toolkit [7] for quickly building
wrappers. The toolkit contains a library for commonly
used functions, such as for receiving qu...

Understanding Vertical Integration in the Internet

The Internet industry is undergoing rapid change as a consequence of
telecommunications deregulation, growth in the demand for and supply of IP-based
services and products, and the need and desire to provide integrated, voice, video and
data services on a single network platform. Currently, the public Internet runs on
infrastructure that is owned by a combination of internet service providers (ISPs) and
traditional telephone companies. In the United States, there are over 4,000 ISPs,
ranging in size from small "mom and pop" operations that provide basic Internet access
services to large international backbone providers. In the United States, there are
currently 32 backbone ISPs (Table 1). These ISPs rely on transport services provided
by the more than 1,600 traditional facilities-based local and long distance telephone
service providers (Table 2).
This industry structure is largely a consequence of legacy regulation and network
design. Historically, telephone service providers were subject to rate regulations and
line of business restrictions, under the presumption that these were a natural monopoly.
Traditional telephone networks were optimized to support a single service, 4KHz voice
telephony. The need to support universal service in a network comprised of multivintage,
long-lived infrastructure deterred anything more than incremental service
innovation. Although the quality of service and reliability of telephone service have
increased dramatically while...

raditionally, distributed applications emphasize a high level of
integration under control of a central authority. These applications
typically map onto private networks or proprietary
value-added networks (VANs). Experience has shown that such applications
are difficult to build, maintain, and enhance. In contrast, federated
applications promise parallel development of individual sites,
flexible adaptation to changing environments, and smooth upgrade
to new technologies.

"Federated" refers to union by alliance rather than integration through
central authority. Distributed Web applications, based upon
server/browser middleware that supports HTTP, HTML, Java, and CGI,
are instances of federated applications.

Ideally, federated applications will simplify implementation, maintenance,
and enhancement of individual sites of distributed enterprises.
In addition, federated approaches facilitate a competitive market
of component services, in which custom systems could be assembled to
the requirements of a given organization by populating a skeleton system
with selecti...

A System for Assembling Specialized Textbooks from
a Pool of Documents

Helena Ahonen, Barbara Heikkinen, Oskari Heinonen and Pekka Kilpel#inen

University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science

We consider assembling specialized, customized textbooks from a large collection of SGML documents.
Our prototype assembly framework allows the user to select parts of the documents in
the collection and to form a new structured document. The order of a user is processed in the
following way. (1) The user lls in and submits an HTML form. (2) The form is processed and the
parts to be included in the assembled book are selected automatically. The choice is dependent
both on the user's input and a few heuristic rules. (3) The texts and images are retrieved from
the pool and the layout is created. (4) The books are printed and delivered to the client. In addition,
we describe our experience on converting MS Word documents into tagged SGML format
by presenting both the conversion architecture and lessons learned.

Systems Research Center

The charter of SRC is to advance both the state of knowledge and the state
of the art in computer systems. From our establishment in 1984, we have
performed basic and applied research to support Digital's business objectives.
Our current work includes exploring distributed personal computing
on multiple platforms, networking, programming technology, system modelling
and management techniques, and selected applications.

Our strategy is to test the technical and practical value of our ideas by
building hardware and software prototypes and using them as daily tools.
Interesting systems are too complex to be evaluated solely in the abstract;
extended use allows us to investigate their properties in depth. This experience
is useful in the short term in refining our designs, and invaluable
in the long term in advancing our knowledge. Most of the major advances
in information systems have come through this strategy, including personal
computing, distributed systems, and the Internet.

We also perform complementary work of a more mathematical flavor. Some
of it is in established fields of theoretical computer science, such as the
analysis of algorithms, computational geometry, and logics of programming.
Other work explores new ground motivated by problems that arise in our
systems research.

We have a strong commitment to communicating our results; exposing and
testing our ideas in the research and development communities leads ...

A tailored document corresponds to the need of a certain user group or user
task. Tailored documents may be constructed through document assembly
from a pool of documents. An intelligent document contains information
that supports this assembly. We suggest different kinds of information that
may be associated with an intelligent document, and used in the assembly
process. We also study the assembly process itself, and the transformations
needed to form the tailored document from fragments of documents. We
report on three case studies, where intelligent document assembly methods
are being prototyped on commercially used document material. As a basis
for the project we consider documents marked up with SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).

Keywords: document assembly, intelligent documents, SGML.

Integration of Different Cooperation

Techniques for Corporate Planning

H. Ludwig, K. Schwab, M. Wittke

Otto-Friedrich-University, Bamberg, Germany

GOALS OF THE PROJECT

Most of today's CSCW systems can be characterized
as special applications, i.e. they only support a specific
type of cooperation or communication instead of taking
care of various cooperative needs of real-life workgroups.
The PlanKo (i.e. cooperative planning) project aims at
a more comprehensive approach to suffice the needs for
an example scenario of corporate planning workgroups.
The PlanKo system is not just a collection of groupware
tools that support several cooperative tasks, but it
integrates different forms of cooperation. Despite its integration,
a CSCW-System has to be open to new forms
of cooperative applications. To achive this a cooperation
tool framework is required that provides basic integration
services for the different cooperative applications.

BASIC ARCHITECTURE

The framework architecture is made up of three software
layers:

The Basic Data Storage Layer provides access to data
jointly used by different cooperations of different types.
To supply a general form of data storage semantics the
system provides capabilities for storing complex objects.
On top of this Basic Data Storage Layer a hypertex...

The CrossFlow architecture provides support for cross-organisational workflow management in
dynamically established virtual enterprises. The creation of a business relationship between a
service provider organisation performing a service on behalf of a consumer organisation can be
made dynamic when augmented by virtual market technology, the dynamic configuration of the
contract enactment infrastructures, and the provision of fine-grained service monitoring and
control.

Standard ways of describing services and contracts can be combined with matchmaking
technology to create a virtual market for such service provision and consumption. A provider can
then advertise its services in the market and consumers can search for a compatible business
partner. This provides choice in selecting a partner and allows the deferment of the decision to a
point in time where it can be made on the most up-to-date requirements of the consumer and
service offers in the market. The penalty for deferred decision making is the time to set up the
infrastructure in each organisation for the dynamically established contract. Thus, a further aspect
of CrossFlow was to exploit the contract in the dynamic and automatic configuration of the contract
enactment and supervision infrastructures of the respective organisations and in linking them in a
dynamic fashion. The electronic contract, which results from the agreement between the newly
established business partners, completely specifies the intended collaboration between them. This
includes fine-grained monitoring and control to allow tight co-operation between the organisati...
